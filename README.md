# CSCI 213 Lab 10: Working with Git
Author: Samantha Gentry 

This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, Car.java, 
which extends the abstract Vehicle class. The Car class contains the following:

1. two instance variables
1. a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
1. getters for the instance variables in this class
1. the toString method
1. the equals method
1. a copy method
